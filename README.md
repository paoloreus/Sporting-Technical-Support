# Chun-chen Lu - 101279412                 -> Add/Delete features

# Status so far: 
# The prototype has passed all requirements so it was established that it would be good to proceed and build on it, Add feature and some routings have been implemented after.
# Front end design is complete. Max is currently linking the files together and adding the dynamic elements. A zip file of the HTML/CSS is in the Mockups branch.
# Max will also add the remaining database fields to the prototype model. I expect our project to be complete by 80% on our next status update. Keep it up :)

# Thanks Everyone! Have fun coding :)
